          <p>&emsp;Coming to web development from a background in music composition, the creative problem-solving required in both music and coding has always strongly interested me. During my work experience in the tech industry, I have become fascinated by the industryâ€™s speed of change and innovation. My ideal goal is to become a junior developer in an environment where I am constantly able to learn and and be challenged, and where I can work alongside driven, motivated peers.</p>
